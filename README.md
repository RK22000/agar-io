# Learning To Play By Loosing

I'm looking to apply this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05588) to a bot that plays [Agar.io](agar.io).

## Step 1, Build the dataset

[X] Create a script that plays Agar io by moving in a straight line.
[X] Train a model to play agar io

## Instrutions to run agar.io model

python main.py

Install any dependenies that prove to be missing
