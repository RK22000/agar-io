# Game plays

I'm gonna record screenshots for game plays in this directory. Later it will be possible to stitch these screen shots into a video of the game play.

__Format of pictures__: `[pic num]-[model X]x[model Y]-[user X]x[user Y].png` or regex `(?P<index>\d+)-(?P<model_pos>\d+x\d+)(-(?P<user_pos>\d+x\d+))?.png`
